## Introduction

This project forms part of the Machine Learning & Statistics module for 2021, please refer to the [project.pdf](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ML-S_2021/blob/main/assessment.pdf) document included in this repository for the full project outline & instructions.

The main objectives of the project include:

1. 

## Repository Files & Folders

List of files & folders contained within the Github Repository:
- datasets folder - Contains csv dataset files used within the repository.
- images folder - Contains image files used within notebooks.
- README.md - This README markdown file.
- .gitignore file -  specifies files to be untracked by git.
- assessment.pdf - full description of the Machine Learning & Statistics assessment & objectives.
- requirements.txt -  list of all Python dependencies used within this repository to ensure it is compatiably with Binder.

## Jupyter Notebook

Note: all descriptive & programming objectives of the assessment have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.

The notebooks are assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therefore all code has been written & runs in Python.

##  Jupyter Notebook Environment

The Jupyter Notebooks can be viewed as a static web page by opening [Scikit-Learn Notebook](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ML-S_2021/blob/main/scikit-learn.ipynb) or [SciPy-Stats Notebook](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/ML-S_2021/blob/main/scipy-stats.ipynb) file directly within this github repository or by clicking the nbviewer links below.

The fully interactive Jupyter notebook can be accessed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), the Python and R programming distribution which includes many data-science specific packages.

1. Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Create a local copy of the Github Repository on your computer, either by downloading the zip file of the repository or by using the Git Clone command, refer to [Github Cloning a Repository Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Open the Anaconda Nagivator via the Windows Start Menu & launch the Jupyter Notebook web application or alternatively by opening terminal (cmd on Windows) & typing ``jupyter notebook``.
4. Within the Jupyter Notebook web application, nagivate to the folder location of the local copy of the repository & open the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file.

**Cloud-Based Services**

Alternatively to downloading & installing  Anaconda & the Jupyter Notebook environment, cloud based servces such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) can be used to easily run a fully interactive Jupyter Notebook in the cloud - see below links.
